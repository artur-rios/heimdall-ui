## Branching model

```
feature/<name> ─┐
fix/<name> ─────┴─▶ develop ──▶ release/x.y.z ──▶ main  (tag vx.y.z)
```

| Branch | Cut from | Merges into | How |
|---|---|---|---|
| `feature/<name>`, `fix/<name>` | `develop` | `develop` | Pull request, squash or merge. The branch is deleted on merge. |
| `release/x.y.z` | `develop` | `main` | Pull request. **Never merged by hand** — see below. |
| `develop`, `main` | — | — | Protected: no direct pushes, no force pushes, no deletion. |

Names are lowercase: letters, digits, `.`, `_` and `-`. A `release/` branch is a snapshot of
`develop` and carries no commits of its own: a fix for a release lands on `develop` through a
`fix/` branch and a new release branch is cut.

The **Branch Policy** workflow checks all of this on every pull request and is a required check
on `develop` and `main`.

## Releasing

1. `git switch develop && git pull && git switch -c release/1.4.0 && git push -u origin release/1.4.0`
   — Jenkins deploys the branch to **homologation**.
2. Open a pull request `release/1.4.0 → main`.
3. When every GitHub check on the pull request passes, Jenkins deploys to **production**. On
   success it sets the `deploy/production` status, merges the pull request with a merge commit,
   creates the tag and GitHub release `v1.4.0`, and deletes the release branch.
4. If the production deploy fails, Jenkins rolls back to the previous image and the pull request
   stays open. Fix on `develop`, then cut a new release.

Follow a release in the **yggdrasil console** (`https://yggdrasil.<domain>`, or the Android app).
The system card shows this application's version, commit, deploy time and health in each
environment.

The repository owner can bypass these rules. That is for emergencies, not for routine work.

## Where this is deployed from

Deployment is managed by [yggdrasil](https://github.com/artur-rios/yggdrasil). This repository is
the application `heimdall-ui` in its `catalog.yaml`, which is what gives it:
- its Jenkins deploy job
- its GitHub rulesets and required checks (the catalog's `checks`)
- its Prometheus scraping
- its place in the console

If a required check is renamed or added here, update the catalog entry, then run
`python github/rulesets.py heimdall-ui` in yggdrasil.
