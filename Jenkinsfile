// Deployment pipeline, run by the self-hosted Jenkins in yggdrasil (github.com/artur-rios/yggdrasil).
//
// All the logic lives in that repository's shared library so the four applications deploy the same
// way. What it does with this repository:
//
//   release/x.y.z pushed                 -> deploy to homologation
//   pull request release/x.y.z -> main   -> wait for every GitHub check to pass, deploy to
//                                           production, merge the pull request, tag vx.y.z,
//                                           delete the release branch
//
// Build and test stay in GitHub Actions; this file only deploys.
